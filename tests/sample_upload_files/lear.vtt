1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:03,156
Did my father strike my gentleman

2
00:00:03,156 --> 00:00:04,566
for chiding of his fool?

3
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,286
Aye, madam.

4
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:09,586
By day and night he wrongs me.

5
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:12,136
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other,

6
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:15,364
that sets us all at odds, I'll not endure it!

7
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:16,566
(Lear screaming)

8
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,906
He's coming, ma'am, I hear him.

9
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,476
Put on what weary negligence you please,

10
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:21,696
you and your fellows.

11
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,496
I'll have it come to question.

12
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:27,980
If he distaste it, let him to my sister.

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,336
Idle old man, that still would manage those authorities

14
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,559
that he hath given away!

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,273
Now, by my life, old fools are babes again

16
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,840
and must be used With cheques as flatteries,

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,598
when they are seen abused.

18
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:46,084
(men shouting)

19
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:51,139
(trumpet blaring)

20
00:00:51,139 --> 00:01:05,159
(men barking)

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,736
How now, what art thou?

22
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,306
A man, sir.

23
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:09,469
What dost thou profess?

24
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,876
I do profess to be no less than I seem.

25
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:14,308
What art thou?

26
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:19,072
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

27
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:22,426
(laughing) If thou be as poor for a subject

28
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:25,333
as he is for a king, thou art poor enough.

29
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,183
What wouldst thou?

30
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:27,016
Service.

31
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:27,974
Who wouldst thou serve?

32
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:28,807
You.

33
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,345
Does thou know me, fellow?

34
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:31,276
No, sir.

35
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:33,306
But you have that in your countenance

36
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,036
that I would fain call master.

37
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:35,869
What's that?

38
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,496
Authority.

39
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,706
Follow me, thou shalt serve me.

40
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:41,476
If I like thee no worse after dinner,

41
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,177
I will not part from thee yet.

42
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:46,552
Dinner, ho, dinner!

43
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:47,396
Where's my knave, my fool?

44
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:48,726
Go you, and call my fool hither.

45
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,696
You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

46
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:52,656
So please you.

47
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:53,489
What says the fellow there?

48
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,026
Call the clotpoll back.

49
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:59,406
Where's my fool, ho?

50
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:01,446
I think the world's asleep.

51
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:02,836
How now where's that mongrel?

52
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:05,006
He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.

53
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:06,806
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?

54
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:10,386
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.

55
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,723
Go you, and tell my daughter I would speak with her.

56
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:13,989
Go you call hither my fool.

57
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:23,896
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir.

58
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,630
Who am I, sir?

59
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,611
My lady's father.

60
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,876
'My lady's father'!

61
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:30,346
My lord's knave.

62
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,086
Your whoreson dog!

63
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:35,034
You slave, you cur!

64
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:36,686
I am none of these, my lord.

65
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,124
I beseech your pardon.

66
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,936
Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

67
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,574
I'll not be struck, my lord!

68
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,596
Nor tripped neither.

69
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,796
I thank thee, fellow.

70
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,806
Thou servest me, and I'll love thee.

71
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,576
Come, sir, arise, away!

72
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,409
I'll teach you differences.

73
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,478
Away, away!

74
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:55,317
If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry.

75
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,698
But away, go to!

76
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,170
If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry.

77
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,669
But away, go to!

78
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,288
Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee.

79
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,666
There's earnest of thy service.

80
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,466
Let me hire him too.

81
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,602
Here's my coxcomb.

82
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:11,898
How now, my pretty knave!

83
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:12,731
How dost thou?

84
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,794
Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

85
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:15,627
Why, fool?

86
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:19,546
Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour.

87
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:22,716
Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,

88
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:23,846
thou'lt catch cold shortly.

89
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:26,629
There, take my coxcomb.

90
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,866
Why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,

91
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,713
and did the third a blessing against his will.

92
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,551
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.

93
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,036
How now, nuncle!

94
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,586
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

95
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,686
Why, my boy?

96
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:45,156
If I gave them all my living,

97
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,796
I'ld keep my coxcombs myself.

98
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:52,066
There's mine, beg another of thy daughters.

99
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,982
Take heed, sirrah, the whip.

100
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:55,646
Oh!

101
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,056
Truth's a dog must to kennel.

102
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:00,226
He must be whipped out, when the Lady Brach

103
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,886
may stand by the fire and stink.

104
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,939
A pestilent gall to me!

105
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,886
Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

106
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:06,719
Do.

107
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,552
Mark it, nuncle.

108
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,126
Have more than thou showest, speak less than thou knowest,

109
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,836
lend less than thou owest,

110
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:15,066
ride more than thou goest, learn more than thou trowest,

111
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,156
set less than thou throwest.

112
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,036
Leave thy drink and thy whore,

113
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,726
and keep in-a-door, and thou shalt have more

114
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,046
than two tens to a score.

115
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,097
By I!

116
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,126
(men cheering)

117
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,908
This is nothing, fool.

118
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:28,246
Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer,

119
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:30,676
you gave me nothing for't.

120
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:34,056
Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

121
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,446
Why, no, boy,

122
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,816
nothing can be made out of nothing.

123
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:40,503
Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to

124
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:41,336
and not believe a fool.

125
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:43,016
A bitter fool!

126
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,276
Dost thou know the difference, my boy,

127
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,076
between a bitter fool and a sweet one?

128
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:47,306
No, lad, teach me.

129
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,976
That lord that counsell'd thee

130
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,776
to give away thy land,

131
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,266
come place him here by me,

132
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,336
do thou for him stand.

133
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,226
The sweet and bitter fool will presently appear.

134
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:03,946
The one in motley here, the other found out there.

135
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,284
Dost thou call me fool, boy?

136
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,876
All thy other titles thou hast given away.

137
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,919
That thou wast born with.

138
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,833
This is not altogether fool, my lord.

139
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,616
Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two crowns.

140
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,476
(laughing) What two crowns shall they be?

141
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,599
Why, after I have cut the egg in the middle,

142
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,046
and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg.

143
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,229
When thou clovest thy crown in the middle,

144
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,216
and gavest away both parts,

145
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:32,124
thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er the dirt.

146
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,816
Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,

147
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,939
when thou gavest thy golden one away.

148

149

152
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:54,169
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

153
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,456
I have used it, nuncle, ever since

154
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,266
thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.

155
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,770
For when thou gavest them the rod,

156
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,521
and put'st down thine own breeches.

157
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:03,826
How now, daughter!

158
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,996
What makes that frontlet on?

159
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:08,126
Methinks you are too much of late in the frown.

160
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,656
Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need

161
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,386
to care for her frowning.

162
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:13,986
Now thou art an O without a figure,

163
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:16,526
I am better than thou art now.

164
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:20,036
I am a fool, thou art nothing.

165
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:22,146
Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue

166
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:25,578
so your face bids me, though you say nothing.

167
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:30,386
Mum, mum.

168
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:33,766
That's a shealed peascod.

169
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,106
Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,

170
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,396
but others of your insolent retinue

171
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,506
do hourly carp and quarrel

172
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:46,856
breaking forth in rank and not-to-be endured riots.

173
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:51,406
Sir, I had thought, by making this well known unto you,

174
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,666
to have found a safe redress,

175
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,286
but now grow fearful, by what yourself

176
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,496
too late have spoke and done.

177
00:06:57,496 --> 00:06:59,536
That you protect this course, and put it on

178
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,216
by your allowance.

179
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:04,066
Which if you should, the fault would not 'scape censure,

180
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,716
nor the redresses sleep,

181
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,936
which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,

182
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,316
might in their working do you that offence,

183
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:12,176
which else were shame,

184
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:15,476
that then necessity will call discreet proceeding.

185
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,243
For, you know, nuncle, the hedge-sparrow

186
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,376
fed the cuckoo so long,

187
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,506
that it's had it head bit off by it young.

188
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:31,521
So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

189
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:36,256
Are you our daughter?

190
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,046
I would you would make use of your good wisdom,

191
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,876
whereof I know you are fraught

192
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,276
and put away these dispositions,

193
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:45,936
that of late transform you from what you rightly are.

194
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:49,536
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?

195
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,746
Whoop, jug!

196
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:59,646
I love thee.

197
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,186
Doth any here know me?

198
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:04,293
This is not Lear.

199
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,346
Doth Lear walk thus, speak thus?

200
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,946
Where are his eyes?

201
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,596
Either his notion weakens,

202
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:11,686
his discernings are lethargied.

203
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:13,965
Ha! Waking, 'tis not so.

204
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:17,506
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

205
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,596
Lear's shadow.

206
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,296
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

207
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,956
This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour

208
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,816
of other your new pranks.

209
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:33,806
I do beseech you to understand my purposes aright.

210
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:37,296
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires.

211
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,956
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,

212
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,186
that this our court, infected with their manners,

213
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:45,326
shows like a riotous inn.

214
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,896
Epicurism and lust makes it more like a tavern or a brothel

215
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,676
than a graced palace.

216
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:54,896
The shame itself doth speak for instant remedy.

217
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,176
Be then desired by her,

218
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,716
that else will take the thing she begs,

219
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:01,476
a little to disquantity your train.

220
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:03,766
And the remainder, that shall still depend,

221
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:06,536
to be such men as may besort your age,

222
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:12,446
which know themselves and you.

223
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:17,856
Darkness and devils!

224
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:21,526
Saddle my horses, call my train together.

225
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,936
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee.

226
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:25,376
Yet have I left a daughter.

227
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,296
You strike my people.

228
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:31,484
And your disorder'd rabble make servants of their betters.

229
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:34,766
Woe, that too late repents,

230
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:35,646
O, sir, are you come?

231
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,479
Is it your will?

232
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,312
Speak, sir.

233
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:41,476
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,

234
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,516
more hideous when thou show'st thee in a child

235
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,756
than the sea-monster!

236
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:48,273
Aye sir, be patient.

237
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:52,302
Detested kite, thou liest!

238
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:53,896
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,

239
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,546
that all particulars of duty know,

240
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,366
and in the most exact regard support

241
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,629
the worships of their name.

242
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:01,536
O most small fault, how ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!

243
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:04,019
That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature

244
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,665
from the fix'd place, drew from my heart all love,

245
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,582
and added to the gall.

246
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,492
O Lear, Lear, Lear!

247
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,493
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,

248
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,936
and thy dear judgment out!

249
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:17,356
Go, go, my people.

250
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,506
My lord, I am guiltless,

251
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,036
as I am ignorant of what hath moved you.

252
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:24,446
It may be so, my lord.

253
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:26,760
Hear, nature, hear.

254
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,326
Dear goddess, hear!

255
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,676
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend

256
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:35,286
to make this creature fruitful!

257
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:38,756
Into her womb convey sterility!

258
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,886
Dry up in her the organs of increase

259
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:44,206
and from her derogate body never spring a babe

260
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,086
to honour her!

261
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,492
If she must teem, create her child of spleen

262
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:52,083
that it may live, and be a thwart disnatured torment to her!

263
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,816
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth

264
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,766
with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks.

265
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:59,676
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits

266
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,656
to laughter and contempt

267
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:04,963
that she may feel how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is

268
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:08,068
to have a thankless child!

269
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:12,783
Away, away!

270
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,986
Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

271
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:17,556
Never afflict yourself to know more of it,

272
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:21,210
but let his disposition have that scope as dotage gives it.

273
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,365
(Lear screaming)

274
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,426
What, fifty of my followers at a clap within a fortnight!

275
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,768
What's the matter, sir?

276
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:31,156
I'll tell thee.

277
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,446
Life and death I am ashamed that thou hast power

278
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:35,026
to shake my manhood thus.

279
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,046
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,

280
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:38,696
should make thee worth them.

281
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:39,529
(whip cracking)

282
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,073
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

283
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,106
The untented woundings of a father's curse

284
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:44,786
pierce every sense about thee!

285
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:47,376
Old fond eyes, beweep this cause again,

286
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,436
I'll pluck ye out, and cast you with the waters

287
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:52,586
that you lose, to temper clay.

288
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,813
Yes, it is come to this?

289
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,456
Let it be so.

290
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:58,966
Yet have I left a daughter,

291
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:01,856
who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.

292
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,986
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails

293
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:08,632
she'll flay thy wolvish visage.

294
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,356
Thou shalt find that I'll resume the shape

295
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:15,485
which thou dost think I have cast off for ever.

296
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,126
Hey!

297
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:21,986
Do you mark that?

298
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,812
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,

299
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:24,987
to the great love I bear you.

300
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:27,136
Pray you, content.

301
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:30,988
What, Oswald, ho!

302
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:39,779
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

303
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,296
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry,

304
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,976
take the fool with thee.

305
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:52,146
This man hath had good counsel, a hundred knights!

306
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,331
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep at point

307
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:55,876
a hundred knights.

308
00:12:55,876 --> 00:13:00,496
Yes, that, on every dream, each buzz, each fancy,

309
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:02,536
each complaint, dislike,

310
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,786
he may enguard his dotage with their powers,

311
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:07,726
and hold our lives in mercy.

312
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,236
Oswald, I say!

313
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:13,356
Well, you may fear too far.

314
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:16,852
Safer than trust too far.

315
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,196
Let me still take away the harms I fear,

316
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:23,886
not fear still to be taken.

317
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,516
I know his heart.

318
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:29,176
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.

319
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,046
If she sustain him and his hundred knights

320
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:34,089
when I have show'd the unfitness.

321
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:34,986
How now, Oswald!

322
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:36,706
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

323
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:37,539
Yes, madam.

324
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,748
Get you gone.
